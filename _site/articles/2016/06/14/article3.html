<h1>Why security matters today</h1>

<p>The big challenge faced by CTSS — which informed architectural decisions in later systems, including the UNIX system from which OS X and iOS are derived — was to allow multiple people to access the same computer without getting in each other’s way. The solution was that each user runs his or her own tasks in an environment that looks like a real computer, but in fact is a sandbox carved out of a shared computer.</p>
