Before iOS 5, view controller containers were a privilege for Apple only. In fact, there was a passage in the view controller programming guide stating that you should not use them. The general advice from Apple on view controllers used to be that a view controller manages a screenful of content. This has since changed to a view controller manages a self-contained unit of content. Why didnâ€™t Apple want us to build our own tab bar controllers and navigation controllers?
